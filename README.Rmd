# Certigo

A simple but powerful workflow manager

- Reproducible: Remembers what scripts and environments were used. One little change triggers a rerun.
- Incremental: Won't rerun if the input did not change
- Output validation: Check whether the output is correct using standard or custom formats
- Modular: Build a complex workflow from self-contained (and tested) modules
- Easy debugging: Copies over a command that will immediately enter the script
