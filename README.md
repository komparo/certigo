# Certigo

A simple but powerful workflow manager

  - Reproducible: Remembers what scripts and environments were used. One
    little change triggers a rerun.
  - Incremental: Won’t rerun if the input did not change
  - Output validation: Check whether the output is correct using
    standard or custom formats
  - Modular: Build a complex workflow from self-contained (and tested)
    modules
  - Easy debugging: Copies over a command that will immediately enter
    the script
